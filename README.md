# CYTHAR-Sequenzer

A pattern-oriented, polyphonic MIDI step-sequencer, which makes its own path.
web: www.cythar.sequenzer.org



# LICENCE

This software are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3. See the file COPYING for details.

# BUILDING

For now we have an ad-hoc script. Just type

<pre>
sh build.sh
</pre>

to build the project. Once it has finished without error an executable called cythar should have been created. Just run that with

<pre>
./cythar
</pre>

# NOTES

I have only used code blocks (dasticcythar.cbp) - no make script.
Targets are defined for Linux, Windows and Mac.

CYTHAR is my first project and i know that the code is not clean. But it's working :-).
It's time for a refactoring now!


Any help is welcome!
