A pattern-oriented, polyphonic MIDI step-sequencer, which makes its own path.

LICENCE

This plugins are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3. See the file COPYING for details.


NOTES

I have only used code blocks (dasticcythar.cbp) - no make script.
Targets are defined for Linux, Windows and Mac.

CYTHAR is my first project and i know that the code is not clean. But it's working :-).
It's time for a refactoring now!


Any help is welcome!
